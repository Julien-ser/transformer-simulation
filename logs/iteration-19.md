# Project-Specific Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous developer working on this specific project.

## Your Role

- Read TASKS.md to understand project requirements
- Complete one task per iteration
- Write clean, well-tested code
- Update TASKS.md with progress
- Commit changes to GitHub (git push)
- Work without asking for permission

## Key Points

1. **No Virtual Environments**: Use the host system's Python, Node.js, etc.
   - Only create venv/Docker if absolutely necessary (document why)

2. **Testing**: Write tests as you build
   - Unit tests for functions
   - Integration tests for features

3. **Documentation**: Every feature should have clear documentation
   - Comments in code
   - README updates
   - Usage examples

4. **Git Workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: [description]"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Task Completion**:
   - Mark complete in TASKS.md with [x]
   - Only mark when fully working and tested
   - If blocked, document the issue and move to next task

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All TASKS.md items marked [x]
- ✅ Code is tested and documented
- ✅ Project runs locally without venv
- ✅ All commits pushed to GitHub
- ✅ README explains how to run the project

Now read TASKS.md and get started!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINTS:
- Iteration: 19 / 64k Token Budget
- Attempt: 3 (previous attempts may have partial progress)
- **Mandate:** Operate efficiently. Use partial edits, not full file rewrites when possible.
- **Output:** Be concise and action-oriented.


## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 19)

```
# transformer-simulation
**Mission:** Make a configuration of a robot simulation that involves a robot turning from humanoid to vehicular form and back. With a ros2 programming loop and everything. World files and whatnot

- [x] **Task 2.3:** Configure sensor placement locations (cameras, LIDAR, IMU) in world for robot perception testing
  - *Deliverable:* Sensor model placements in world file with ROS2 sensor plugin configurations
- [x] **Task 2.4:** Create demo scenario spawn points for both humanoid and vehicular configurations
  - *Deliverable:* Spawn coordinates documented in `config/spawn_points.yaml` and world file entity placements

  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/urdf/humanoid.urdf` with at least 15 DOF, collision meshes, and visual STL references
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Design complete URDF for vehicular robot form with wheel joints and compact body
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/urdf/vehicular.urdf` with wheel joints, reduced profile, and shared component references to humanoid parts
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Create unified URDF with transformation definitions - both forms must share common base link and reusable components
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/urdf/transformer_complete.urdf.xacro` using xacro includes for shared components and conditional joint visibility
- [x] **Task 3.4:** Build 3D mesh assets (STL/Collada) for all robot components: limbs, wheels, body segments, transformation mechanisms

  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_gazebo/launch/transformer_simulation.launch.py` with arguments for initial form, world selection, and controller configuration
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Create autonomous demonstration node that decides when to transform based on mission objectives (navigate to point, obstacle clearance)
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_control/src/autonomous_mission.cpp` implementing simple logic: switch to vehicular for long-distance travel, humanoid for obstacle negotiation
- [ ] **Task 5.3:** Develop RViz configuration for visualization of robot state, joint states, and transformation progress
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/rviz/transformer_visualization.rviz` with display groups for both forms, joint tree view, and TF tree
- [ ] **Task 5.4:** Create comprehensive end-to-end test scenario that demonstrates complete transformation cycle with goals
  - *Deliverable:* Test launch `transformer_gazebo/launch/test_transformation_scenario.launch.py` that: spawns humanoid, walks 5m, transforms to vehicular, drives 10m, transforms back, completes objective
```
```

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
**Task 4.2:** Develop transformation state machine node that handles mode switching between humanoid and vehicular configurations

**Instructions:** Complete this task. Mark [x] in TASKS.md when done. Create, modify, or delete files as needed. Execute commands as needed. Also update README.md to match this project (name, setup instructions, current progress). No permission needed—just act.
```

Perfect! Now I have a clear understanding of the structure. Let me create the transformation state machine node.

The state machine will:
- Use ROS2 lifecycle with states: `UNCONFIGURED`, `INACTIVE`, `ACTIVE`, `ERROR`
- Manage transformation between humanoid and vehicular forms
- Control which controllers are active
- Publish transformation progress
- Provide services to trigger transformations

Let me create the transformation_state_machine.cpp:

The code is correct for ROS2, the LSP errors are because ROS2 isn't installed in the current environment. Let me create the necessary custom message and service definitions, then update the CMakeLists.txt.

## Phase 3: Robot Modeling & URDF Development
- [x] **Task 3.1:** Design complete URDF for humanoid robot form with articulated joints (head, arms, legs, torso)
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/urdf/humanoid.urdf` with at least 15 DOF, collision meshes, and visual STL references
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Design complete URDF for vehicular robot form with wheel joints and compact body
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/urdf/vehicular.urdf` with wheel joints, reduced profile, and shared component references to humanoid parts
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Create unified URDF with transformation definitions - both forms must share common base link and reusable components
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/urdf/transformer_complete.urdf.xacro` using xacro includes for shared components and conditional joint visibility
- [x] **Task 3.4:** Build 3D mesh assets (STL/Collada) for all robot components: limbs, wheels, body segments, transformation mechanisms
  - *Deliverable:* Mesh files in `transformer_description/meshes/` with proper copyright headers, optimized triangle counts (<5k each), and collision shapes

## Phase 4: ROS2 Control & Transformation Logic
- [x] **Task 4.1:** Implement ROS2 control configuration for both robot forms with joint state controllers and effort/position interfaces
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_control/config/control.yaml` with separate controller configurations for humanoid (`humanoid_controllers.yaml`) and vehicular (`vehicular_controllers.yaml`) modes
- [ ] **Task 4.2:** Develop transformation state machine node that handles mode switching between humanoid and vehicular configurations
  - *Deliverable:* C++/Python node `transformer_control/src/transformation_state_machine.cpp` with ROS2 lifecycle, state transitions, joint locking/releasing logic, and safety checks
- [ ] **Task 4.3:** Create transformation execution controller that animates the morphing process with joint trajectories
  - *Deliverable:* Transformation trajectory generator in `transformer_control/src/transformation_controller.cpp` publishing to `joint_trajectory_controller` with interpolation and collision avoidance
- [ ] **Task 4.4:** Implement safety monitoring node that validates transformation poses, prevents illegal transitions, and handles failures
  - *Deliverable:* Safety monitor node `transformer_control/src/safety_monitor.cpp` with joint limit checks, self-collision detection, and emergency stop service

## Phase 5: Integration & Autonomous Loop
- [ ] **Task 5.1:** Build unified launch file that can spawn robot in either configuration and start all required nodes
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_gazebo/launch/transformer_simulation.launch.py` with arguments for initial form, world selection, and controller configuration
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Create autonomous demonstration node that decides when to transform based on mission objectives (navigate to point, obstacle clearance)
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_control/src/autonomous_mission.cpp` implementing simple logic: switch to vehicular for long-distance travel, humanoid for obstacle negotiation
- [ ] **Task 5.3:** Develop RViz configuration for visualization of robot state, joint states, and transformation progress
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/rviz/transformer_visualization.rviz` with display groups for both forms, joint tree view, and TF tree
- [ ] **Task 5.4:** Create comprehensive end-to-end test scenario that demonstrates complete transformation cycle with goals
  - *Deliverable:* Test launch `transformer_gazebo/launch/test_transformation_scenario.launch.py` that: spawns humanoid, walks 5m, transforms to vehicular, drives 10m, transforms back, completes objective
