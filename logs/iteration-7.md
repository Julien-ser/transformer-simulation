# Project-Specific Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous developer working on this specific project.

## Your Role

- Read TASKS.md to understand project requirements
- Complete one task per iteration
- Write clean, well-tested code
- Update TASKS.md with progress
- Commit changes to GitHub (git push)
- Work without asking for permission

## Key Points

1. **No Virtual Environments**: Use the host system's Python, Node.js, etc.
   - Only create venv/Docker if absolutely necessary (document why)

2. **Testing**: Write tests as you build
   - Unit tests for functions
   - Integration tests for features

3. **Documentation**: Every feature should have clear documentation
   - Comments in code
   - README updates
   - Usage examples

4. **Git Workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: [description]"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Task Completion**:
   - Mark complete in TASKS.md with [x]
   - Only mark when fully working and tested
   - If blocked, document the issue and move to next task

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All TASKS.md items marked [x]
- ✅ Code is tested and documented
- ✅ Project runs locally without venv
- ✅ All commits pushed to GitHub
- ✅ README explains how to run the project

Now read TASKS.md and get started!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINTS:
- Iteration: 7 / 64k Token Budget
- Attempt: 1 (previous attempts may have partial progress)
- **Mandate:** Operate efficiently. Use partial edits, not full file rewrites when possible.
- **Output:** Be concise and action-oriented.


## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 7)

```
# transformer-simulation
**Mission:** Make a configuration of a robot simulation that involves a robot turning from humanoid to vehicular form and back. With a ros2 programming loop and everything. World files and whatnot

  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/urdf/humanoid.urdf` with at least 15 DOF, collision meshes, and visual STL references
- [ ] **Task 3.2:** Design complete URDF for vehicular robot form with wheel joints and compact body
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/urdf/vehicular.urdf` with wheel joints, reduced profile, and shared component references to humanoid parts

- [ ] **Task 4.2:** Develop transformation state machine node that handles mode switching between humanoid and vehicular configurations
  - *Deliverable:* C++/Python node `transformer_control/src/transformation_state_machine.cpp` with ROS2 lifecycle, state transitions, joint locking/releasing logic, and safety checks
- [ ] **Task 4.3:** Create transformation execution controller that animates the morphing process with joint trajectories
  - *Deliverable:* Transformation trajectory generator in `transformer_control/src/transformation_controller.cpp` publishing to `joint_trajectory_controller` with interpolation and collision avoidance

## Phase 5: Integration & Autonomous Loop
- [ ] **Task 5.1:** Build unified launch file that can spawn robot in either configuration and start all required nodes
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_gazebo/launch/transformer_simulation.launch.py` with arguments for initial form, world selection, and controller configuration
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Create autonomous demonstration node that decides when to transform based on mission objectives (navigate to point, obstacle clearance)
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_control/src/autonomous_mission.cpp` implementing simple logic: switch to vehicular for long-distance travel, humanoid for obstacle negotiation
- [ ] **Task 5.3:** Develop RViz configuration for visualization of robot state, joint states, and transformation progress
  - *Deliverable:* `transformer_description/rviz/transformer_visualization.rviz` with display groups for both forms, joint tree view, and TF tree
- [ ] **Task 5.4:** Create comprehensive end-to-end test scenario that demonstrates complete transformation cycle with goals
  - *Deliverable:* Test launch `transformer_gazebo/launch/test_transformation_scenario.launch.py` that: spawns humanoid, walks 5m, transforms to vehicular, drives 10m, transforms back, completes objective
```
```

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
